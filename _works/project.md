                    <p>At PORTGATE we recognize that every large-scale project is important. It is different from classic shipping services because often cargo is unsuitable for transport in standard sized shipping containers, wagons and trailers. These items are usually transported as individual pieces due to being oversized and overweight.  Transportation of large scale projects requires experienced and knowledgeable employees prepared to research all options, analyze possible challenges and promptly react to critical situations. PORTGATE uses functional, practical and sound logistics principles, when handling oversized and overweight cargo.  We will always guarantee a solid agenda of flexible transportation services and practical solutions.
 We have experience in break-bulk cargo with the most of it specializing in Industrial Machinery, Construction, Mining Equipment and other types of freight that require special attention. RO/RO (roll-on, roll-off) cargo for commodities such as vehicles is another field in which we can provide you with a tailored service. We take care of any additional services required, such as special cranes, and transport to guarantee your cargo is loaded and unloaded without any problem.
