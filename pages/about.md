Our history begins in 1999, with the foundation of the “Trans Iberia Transit” (“TIT”) railway transportation company in Tbilisi, Georgia. For the past two decades, the company has been positioning itself as a leader in its field in the Caucasus region. Operating within the Transport Corridor Europe-Caucasus-Asia (TRACECA), “TIT” became known as the “GATE” to the Central Asia.For years, the company has been able to successfully maintain its status of a reliable partner for project transportations. А trusted partner network and experienced personnel have always been the company’s main assets.Since its establishment, “TIT” has considerably expanded its global partner network. It began to offer maritime and air transportation services in addition to the railway transportation.

To address the business growth challenges and the needs of the logistics market in the 21st century, it was later decided to set up a subsidiary company. Thus, the “PORTGATE” company was established in Tbilisi in 2018.

Today PORTGATE carries out all kinds of international cargo transportation mainly in the Caucasus region, Central Asia and the CIS countries. The majority of the transportations are completed through the TRACECA corridor.

PORTGATE was able to effectively enhance its success and profitability by leveraging a growing rate of freight traffic in this region.

The main office of the PORTGATE company is located in Tbilisi, Georgia. It also has offices in various cities recognized as transportation hubs, such as: Poti (Georgia), Chornomorsk (Ukraine) and Kuryk (Kazakhstan). It is planned to open a new office in Anaklia (Georgia) by 2020 as well. PORTGATE takes pride in continuing partnership with many modern European warehouses in Istanbul (Turkey), Prague (Czech Republic) and Stuttgart (temperature controlled warehouse in Germany).
